CURRENT ENDPOINTS

POST
/api/post_example
Test endpoint. I can test it and succeed with a curl in terminal, but not with test.py. Current roadblock.

/api/event_collection
Endpoint for sensor to theoretically post recordingId, sensorId, time, and stepTrue
I'm sure how this works will change, it's just a placeholder for now

GET
/api/sensor_info_test 
Test endpoint, receives sensorId (int) and name (string)
